# Tailwind CSS Class Application Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem where certain Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly in a React project, despite seemingly correct usage and a clean build process.

## Problem Description

Several Tailwind CSS utility classes, specifically `bg-red-500` and `hover:bg-blue-700` in this example, are not rendering as expected.  Other classes within the same project *do* work correctly, ruling out simple build or configuration errors.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3.  Run `npm start` to start the development server.

Observe that the background color does not change as expected.

## Possible Causes

* **Conflicting CSS:**  Overriding stylesheets or improperly ordered CSS rules may interfere with Tailwind's classes.
* **Purge Configuration:** Incorrect configuration of Tailwind's purge process may result in classes being removed from the final CSS bundle.
* **Build Process:** Issues within the build or bundling process may prevent Tailwind's classes from being included correctly.
* **Typos or Syntax Errors:** A simple typo in the class names could be the reason.
